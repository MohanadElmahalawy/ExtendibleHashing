# Extendible Hashing Implementation

A console-based application demonstrating the implementation of Extendible Hashing, an efficient dynamic hashing technique for database indexing and other storage solutions. Developed in C++ with Object-Oriented Programming and Data Structures.

## Features
- Implements the Extendible Hashing algorithm to dynamically manage hash tables.
- Supports key operations such as insertion, deletion, and searching for records.
- Automatically adjusts the hash table structure to handle collisions and maintain efficiency.
- Demonstrates the use of directory doubling and bucket splitting techniques.
- Provides a clear and user-friendly interface to test the functionality.

## Main Technologies Used
- C++
- Data Structures
